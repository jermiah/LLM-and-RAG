    "\n",
    "The goal was to design a robust QA inference pipeline to answer security and compliance questions using existing labeled training data. The challenge involves handling varying user queries with high accuracy, personalization, and compute efficiency — ideal for an enterprise SaaS platform like Skypher.\n",

    "**Why We Used `json5` and Still Cleaned the JSON**\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, we used the `json5` package to quickly load training data that included **non-standard formatting**, such as:\n",
    "- Single-quoted string values\n",
    "- Trailing commas\n",
    "- Inline comments or malformed JSON blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "While `json5` enabled rapid iteration, it is **not suitable for production** due to the following risks:\n",
    "- Permits syntax that violates strict JSON standards\n",
    "- Hides structural issues that may break downstream tools\n",
    "- Lacks schema enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Solution**\n",
    "- Built a custom JSON format validator (`detect_json_format_errors`) to detect:\n",
    "  - Structural inconsistencies\n",
    "  - Use of single quotes\n",
    "  - Commas before closing braces\n",
    "- Applied automated fixes via:\n",
    "  - `fix_all_single_quoted_values()`\n",
    "  - `fix_commas_before_closing_brace()`\n",
    "- Re-parsed the cleaned output using standard `json` to ensure compatibility and robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification**\n",
    "- Loaded both `json5` and cleaned `json` into separate DataFrames\n",
    "- Used `.equals()` to confirm both versions held **identical data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures:\n",
    "- **Fault-tolerant development**\n",
    "- **Strict compliance in production**\n",
    "- **No accidental loss of training data fidelity**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We structured the EDA into four focused blocks to better understand the data distributions, inconsistencies, and modeling implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Descriptions (Assumptions)**\n",
    "\n",
    ">These column descriptions are inferred based on the structure and content of the dataset. The original task description does not formally define the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **question**: The text of the security-related question (e.g., \"Are unique IDs required for authentication...?\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **control**: A hashed identifier presumed to represent the security control or compliance policy associated with the question. It may correspond to frameworks such as NIST or ISO. Potentially useful for categorization or filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **user_id**: A unique identifier of the user or system that submitted or answered the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **answer**: The company’s response to the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **date**: The timestamp when the Q&A pair was recorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Model Used:** `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "- BGE models are specifically trained for embedding-based search and retrieval tasks.\n",
    "- `bge-large-en-v1.5` achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MTEB benchmarks and is optimized for question answering (QA).\n",
    "- It supports **embedding normalization**, making it ideal for **FAISS + inner product (cosine similarity)**.\n",
    "- Out-of-the-box effectiveness, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variants Used:**\n",
    "- `question_only` → For general semantic retrieval.\n",
    "- `question + [USER] user_id` → For personalized embedding space when test user_id is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Train Data Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure**: Training data was originally loaded from a nested `training.json` format with answers embedded under numeric question keys.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Extracted all question-answer pairs into a flat DataFrame for easy manipulation.\n",
    "- **Statistics**:\n",
    "  - ~258 total training examples.\n",
    "  - Only **30 unique answers**, but questions are phrased very differently.\n",
    "- **Insight**: Answers are reused across multiple semantically similar questions, motivating classification and retrieval modeling. The control column has only 6 unique values across 258 records, with the most frequent control ID (610c09161b4a094766c59e66) appearing 127 times. This indicates that many questions are mapped to a small set of recurring security controls, which may reflect common focus areas such as access management, authentication, or policy enforcement. The date column shows that all entries fall within a ~3-month window (from May 20 to August 28, 2021). This narrow time range suggests that there are no temporal outliers due to extremely old or unusually recent records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Test Data Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loaded the test dataset (`test.csv`) and cleaned questions using the same logic applied to training (e.g., removing bracketed content).\n",
    "- **Validation Check**:\n",
    "  - Found **41 test questions** that exactly match training questions (after cleaning).\n",
    "  - Of these, **7 test entries** also match on `user_id`, enabling **high-confidence personalized retrieval**.\n",
    "- **Implication**: Test set follows a controlled distribution (likely from security standards), allowing us to exploit exact match optimization logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character/Word Distributions**:\n",
    "  - Questions are short and range from ~50–200 characters, mostly factual in nature.\n",
    "  - Answers are concise, often templated, aiding in classifier performance.\n",
    "- **Label Frequency**:\n",
    "  - High class imbalance (some answers appear >10 times, others only once).\n",
    "  - Informed our decision to use `class_weight=\"balanced\"` in classification models.\n",
    "- **Question-Answer Overlap**:\n",
    "  - Several test questions resemble paraphrased versions of training questions.\n",
    "  - Reinforces the need for both lexical (BM25) and semantic (embedding) retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unified all question text using a consistent cleaning pipeline:\n",
    "  - Removed `[5.3]` type annotations\n",
    "  - Stripping whitespace, lowercasing.\n",
    "  - Removing instructional tags (e.g., \"Single selection allowed\").\n",
    "  - Removed question number prefixes like `6.2.1`, `Q1.` etc.\n",
    "- Cleaned answers to remove trailing whitespace and export artifacts.\n",
    "- Justification: Ensures text consistency across string-based comparison, classification, and embedding steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Assumption**:  \n",
    "As this is a **security questionnaire**, the same or similar questions are frequently reused across users and forms, due to standardized security protocols (e.g., ISO, NIST). Hence, **test data was analyzed upfront** to validate that **exact match logic is justified** in this context. This modeling assumption would **not generalize to open-domain QA** but is appropriate for structured enterprise security reviews.\n",

    "**Hybrid System**\n",

    "- **Supervised classification** (for speed),\n",
    "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (for flexible, context-aware answers).\n",

    "**Motivation**: Combine precision by exact match(early exit), classifier,lexicon and retrieval with LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Exact Match (Rule-Based)**\n",
    "- Return the answer immediately if both `question_clean` and `user_id` match training data → **High Confidence**\n",
    "- Return training answer if `question_clean` matches (ignoring user) → **Medium Confidence**\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Zero compute, perfect precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Classifier (Supervised)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generic Classifier (question-only)**\n",
    "- Input: Sentence embedding of the cleaned question.\n",
    "- Use Case: Acts as a fallback when user-specific context is not available in training.\n",
    "- Advantage: Fast, generalizable to new users or unseen user_ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Ensures we still provide a top-5 classification output when no personalized training data exists for that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User-Aware Classifier (question + user_id)**\n",
    "- Input: Embedding of question + [USER] user_id.\n",
    "- Use Case: Prioritized when test user_id matches training data.\n",
    "- Advantage: Encodes per-user preferences or policies (e.g., different SSO setups or MFA rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Enables personalized answer prediction, improving accuracy and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. BM25 Retrieval (Lexical)**\n",
    "- Search similar past questions using tokenized BM25.\n",
    "- Tokenized and pre-cached training corpus.\n",
    "- **Query:** Cleaned and tokenized test question.\n",
    "- **BM25Okapi:** Returns top-5 based on token overlap relevance.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Captures lexical similarity. Weak on semantic rewording.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dense Retrieval (Semantic)**\n",
    "- **FAISS Indexes:**\n",
    "  - `index_q_only`: BGE embeddings of cleaned questions.\n",
    "  - `index_q_user`: BGE embeddings with user augmentation.\n",
    "- **Query:** Test question embedded via same model.\n",
    "- **Output:** Returns top-5 closest training questions based on cosine similarity.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Strong for semantically similar but lexically different questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Candidate Deduplication**\n",
    "- Combine all results from classifier + BM25 + dense retrieval.\n",
    "- Deduplicate based on `(question, answer)` pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Cross-Encoder Reranking**\n",
    "- **Model:** `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`\n",
    "- **Input:** Pairs `(test_question_clean, candidate_question)`.\n",
    "- **Output:** Relevance score per candidate.\n",
    "- **Filter:** Retain candidates with score ≥ `threshold = 1.0`.\n",
    "- **Why:** Improves precision by aligning test-query with context-rich Q/A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. LLM Generation**\n",
    "- **Model**: `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` (quantized, 4-bit NF4).\n",
    "- Inputs a crafted prompt including top retrieved QAs.\n",
    "- Generates under 45-word precise answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "**High Confidence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "7 test questions matched both question_clean and user_id → returned exact user-personalized answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium Confidence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "34 additional test questions matched only question_clean → reused prior answers from training (generic).\n",

    "**2. Classification Model Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained two variants of a Logistic Regression classifier to predict answers from embeddings:\n",

    "\n",
    "Why Macro F1?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Macro F1 gives equal importance to all 30 classes, making it better suited for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class-Weighted Training:** We used class_weight='balanced' to avoid bias toward frequent answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Per-Class Scores:** We monitored F1 scores across all classes to ensure rare but critical classes weren’t ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LLM-Based Generation Evaluation**\n",
    "For the remaining 60+ test questions, the system used a hybrid retrieval + generation approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality Control:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs to LLM were reranked via a Cross Encoder (MiniLM-L6) to improve answer relevance.\n",

    "**Evaluation Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human inspection:** Spot-checked answers for factual accuracy and conciseness.\n",
